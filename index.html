          <p class="about-me-body">
            My earliest memory of being captivated by the world of technology dates back to middle school 
            when I was gifted a computer for my birthday. I found myself absorbed with intrigue and would spend 
            hours trying to crack the code to its endless puzzles. 
            
            Since then my career has been wide and varied, ranging from being a children’s director of a non-profit 
            to a freelance graphic designer to a Technical Expert then Genius at Apple. Along the way, I’ve picked up 
            skills and insights that have forged my path back to computers, ultimately leading to me becoming a developer. 
            While working for the non-profit, unsurprisingly, I was a one-man-band. I taught myself Adobe Photoshop, 
            After Effects, and Premiere. That self-driven learning experience uniquely prepared me for the world of 
            coding where I can contribute to building something from the ground up. From here, I’m ready to move into a 
            growing field where I can be challenged and invigorated by the work created or produced. </p>
